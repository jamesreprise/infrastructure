# Infrastructure
Collection of machines defined with nix.
## Machines
### Primetime
Content & media server.

### Mind
Development machine.

## Todo
- [ ] Create a unified configuration.

## Notes
* We use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) for secret encryption.
* Some machines folders contain extra files to get them up and running (e.g. 
 bootstrap/ for Primetime. You can safely ignore these if you aren't seeking
 to replicate the exact setup.)
