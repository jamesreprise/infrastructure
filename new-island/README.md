# New Island
New Island is configuration for mobile devices - mostly laptops.

This happens in two parts, configuration/ and home-manager/.
## configuration/
configuration.nix and system configuration files using NixOS and nix-darwin.

## home-manager/
This consists of standalone home manager configurations using flakes.
Easily hot-loaded onto other machines that support using Nix as a package.
